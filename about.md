## Currently developing at Microsoft. Previously a co-founder of [WebsitePanel](http://bit.ly/1OBrHFE).

Hi, my name is Pavel Tsurbeleu. I am a developer living and working in Seattle area. Originally from Belarus, I worked my way up as a developer at variety of software companies and projects. In 2006, I joined the WebsitePanel (aka DotNetPanel) project as a co-founder alongside with [Feodor Fitsner](http://bit.ly/1RvMCQx) to disrupt the hosting management software industry with awesome ideas. There, I designed, developed, supported and improved lots of things for the WebsitePanel team, product and customers.

In late 2010, after a 4-year journey with WebsitePanel, I joined Microsoft following the project's acquisition.
