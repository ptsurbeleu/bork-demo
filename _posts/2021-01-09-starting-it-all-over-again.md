title: Starting it all over again
---
Some things just work, others work better while the rest is barely holding up together or not working at all.

We, human beings like things that work.

In this new year of **2021** I wish you, dear reader, all the things that work. Things that work for your business, your career, your family, your marriage, your wellbeing, your wealth and of course that work for **y-o-u-r-s-e-l-f**.

Happy New Year!
