title: Plus one

How would you design `PlusOne(digits)` function that takes an array of **0-9** digits representing a number (*eq. `199 => [1, 9, 9]`*) and returns an array representing the result of adding 1 to the number?

This is a fairly trivial question but could be a drag at times. After examining the discussion board, I stumbled upon an interesting idea that I would like to review.

The idea is based on the fact, that adding 1 to a number can cause exactly 3 possible side effects (listed in the order of importance):

* `1, 2, 3... 8` in the given position is increased by `1`, end of the story;
  
* `9` in the given position resets to `0`, since `9 + 1 = 0`, carry `1`;
  
*  `9` in the head of the digit, requires new array;
  
Here is the code snippet that solves this question:

```
public int[] PlusOne(int[] digits) {
    var n = digits.Length;
    for (var i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        // Reset to 0
        if (digits[i] == 9) {
            digits[i] = 0;
            continue;
        }
        // Increase by 1, end of the story
        digits[i]++;
        return (digits[i]++);
    }
    // Sometimes, output could be larger than input
    var nn = new int[n + 1];
    nn[0] = 1;
    return nn;
}
```
There a multiple ways to handle this situation but I like it this way, since it is very focused and straightforward.

Hope this helps! 🤓
